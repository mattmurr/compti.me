**Clean microphone quality** is important for people who work remotely in this
digital world, both for the benefit of yourself being heard and the energy of the people listening to you.

My Øverkill audio setup:

- [RØDE NT5 matched pair](https://rode.com/en/microphones/studio-condenser/nt5)
  small diaphragm condenser mics on a stereo bar in an XY setup.
- [Motu M4](https://motu.com/en-us/products/m-series/m4/) audio interface.
- [JBL 305P MKII](https://jblpro.com/products/305p-mkii) studio monitors.
- [Sennheiser HD650](https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-UK/p/hd-650/)
  headphones at the WFH desk.

**Edit**: Recently I started to only use the Apple AirPods Pro 2 for my day-to-day
activities, and only bring out the big boys for demos, talks and recordings.

**Edit 2**: The AirPods started acting weird, I'm now using the [Beyerdynamic Blue BYRD Gen2](https://www.soundguys.com/beyerdynamic-blue-byrd-2nd-generation-review-66342/)
