**Good microphone quality** is important for people who work remotely in this
digital world.

Let's be honest, it's draining to try and listen to somebody for more than 5-10
minutes if they have a bad mic - I admittedly avoid those people, I'd rather
invest my energy into deep meaningful work, sorry. I've found that **the person
who speaks the loudest, and has the most presence in the room is more likely to
be noticed, and will reap the rewards**, but of course, this doesn't matter if
your words are not understood. And this is amplified in the world of today,
where a lot of us spend most of our time, remote working.

Let's all try to consider our listeners by just **making sure we sound OK.**
Record yourself and listen back... Your built-in laptop microphone may be good
enough, or on the other hand, potato grade ðŸ¥”.

For anyone interested, my Ã˜verkill audio setup:

- [RÃ˜DE PodMic](https://rode.com/en/microphones/broadcast/podmic) dynamic
  microphone.
- [Klark Teknik CM-1](https://www.klarkteknik.com/product.html?modelCode=P0DPA) -
  Microphone boosters are a no-brainer for some dynamic mics, especially if you
  are softly spoken (remember, you want to have good presence).
- [Motu M2](https://motu.com/en-us/products/m-series/m2/) audio interface.
- [Sennheiser HD650](https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-UK/p/hd-650/)
  headphones at my WFH desk.
- [Apple AirPods Pro 2](https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-pro/) earphones for on
  the go. The microphones sound good enough for remote calls.

**Edit**: Recently I started to only use the AirPods for my day-to-day
activities.
