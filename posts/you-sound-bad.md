**Audible microphone quality** is important for people who work remotely in this
digital world.

My Øverkill audio setup:

- [RØDE PodMic](https://rode.com/en/microphones/broadcast/podmic) dynamic
  microphone.
- [Klark Teknik CM-1](https://www.klarkteknik.com/product.html?modelCode=P0DPA) -
  Microphone boosters are a no-brainer for some dynamic mics, especially if you
  are softly spoken.
- [RØDE NT5 matched pair](https://rode.com/en/microphones/studio-condenser/nt5)
  small diaphram condenser mics on a stereo bar in an XY setup.
- [Motu M2](https://motu.com/en-us/products/m-series/m2/) audio interface.
- [JBL 306P MKII](https://jblpro.com/products/306p-mkii) studio monitors.
- [Audient Evo 8](https://evo.audio/products/audio-interfaces/evo-8/overview/)
  audio interface.
- [Sennheiser HD650](https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-UK/p/hd-650/)
  headphones at my WFH desk.
- [Apple AirPods Pro 2](https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-pro/) earphones for on
  the go. The microphones sound good enough for remote calls.

**Edit**: Recently I started to only use the AirPods for my day-to-day
activities and bring out the big mics for demos, talks and recordings.
