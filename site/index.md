## About

I'm Matt, I graduated from a [data engineering bootcamp](https://uk.generation.org)
and now work for a tech consultancy in the UK. I love ThinkPads, Linux and
obtaining new knowledge about anything tech.

This is my blog where I note and post about Software Engineering, Cloud,
Unix and various other tech.
