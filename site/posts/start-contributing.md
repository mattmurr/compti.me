I am a self-taught developer and managed to land my first tech job just over a
year ago. Before that, I was stuck in an endless cycle of not knowing if I'm
good enough (most definitely Imposters Syndrome). It wasn't until I managed to
join a training programme offered by
[Generation UK](https://uk.generation.org/), that I realized that I'm here, and
I'm good enough to be doing this. One of the best ways to progress, is to just
get stuck in.

Software, like many other things are often best built through collaboration,
good ol' teamwork. Of course, you can produce great software as a lone wolf, and
there is nothing wrong with that, but it's likely that a lot of the time, you
are not going to be the only person working on a codebase; together with others,
you will be contributing code that delivers value towards a larger goal.

One of the things I struggled with the most in the past few years, before and
after landing my first tech job, is mustering up the courage to put my work on
show. I want to lay out my retrospective thoughts on what helped me to push past
this hurdle.

## How can you contribute?

Contributing to projects often requires a certain level of knowledge on the
technology and code-base; on top of this, you have to go through the often
rigorous code review pretty daunting for a beginner.

Here are some tips:

1. Keep your changes minimal
   - Make sure your changes stay within the scope of the issue
   - Find the simplest implementation
     ([KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle))
2. Ask a buddy to review your changes
3. Make sure you follow the project's formatting and linting rules (, even if
   you don't agree with them)
4. Endeavour to write tests that cover all conditions of your logic

## Found a bug?

When you find a bug in a code-base you have a few choices:

1. Ignore it (please don't do this)
2. Let the maintainers know by posting an issue (check first to see if this bug
   was already raised)
3. Start a PR to fix it

Posting an issue is considered contributing, try to include as much information
as you can, consider adding reproducible scenarios. Maintainers often use an
issue template to enforce higher quality issues.

## Maintainers

Project maintainers, you can encourage contribution; try your best to ensure
issues are refined, tag/label tickets and suggest potential steps to solve the
issue, this enables potential contributors to start hacking away.
