title: Efficient workflows
description: Efficient workflows are not necessarily optimal for you

Ever since I discovered the world of Unix, I'd continuously try and _improve_ my
workflow; obsessed and committed to making my workflow more efficient, entire
weekends spent distro-hopping and rewriting dotfiles. My time would be better
spent writing actual code, or better yet, having an actual break on the
weekends. Is this some sort of awful addiction?

My workflow was evolving quickly, feature after feature at the cost of
simplicity, and unfortunately this is nearly the opposite of what my intentions
were. I've decided to keep the one best about my setup, editing with `vi` while
reverting the more complex things.

Time to start following the <abbr title="Keep it stupid simple">KISS</abbr>
philosophy and making optimizations for myself rather than falling into this
spiral of dots again.
