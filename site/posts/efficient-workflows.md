Ever since I discovered the world of Unix, I'd continuously try and _improve_ my workflow; obsessed and committed to making my workflow more efficient, I could spend entire weekends distro-hopping and rewriting my dotfiles. My time would be better spent writing actual code, or better yet, having a break on the weekends.

My workflow was evolving quickly, feature after feature at the cost of simplicity, and unfortunately this is nearly the opposite of what my intentions were. I've decided to keep the best things about my setup, editing with `vi` and `tmux` while reverting the more complex things. Bye Nix.

Time to start following the <abbr title="Keep it stupid simple">KISS</abbr> philosophy and making optimisations for myself rather than following the numbers on a benchmark.
